- Mesage Queuing Telemetry Transport
- extremly lightweight
- extreme suitable for low bandwith and or low bandwith, ocassional dialup connections ( which is
occassionally even a characteristics of mobile networks

- small code footprints
- has a telemetry backround, collecting data from sensors
- Facebook messanger uses MQTT
- last will approach
- 3 QoS , max 1 , min 1, exactly 1
- possible fire and forget or reliable communication

- MQTT available for Android, Web (via e.g Websocket), arduino (SoC) , IOS , Internet of Things approach all
  M2M UC based on TCP / IP or using MQTT-S for non TCP/IP Networks

- Server Facts : Eclipse Paho , ActiveMQ (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18632968/mqtt-android-not-connecting-to-activemq?rq=1)

detailed facts
-> Based on TCP/IP but for non TCP IP Networks MQTT-S implementation available. (more detailed UC later on)
-> Header only fixed 2 Bytes long, reduces administration overhead
-> Fire and Forget / Last Will Statement
    + LastWillStatement (LWT) not gone offline concern but what happens after a client has gone offline. Care of gone of line
      the keep alive message is appropriate
      Instead of just closing the connection after a client has gone offline,
      LWT messages can be leveraged to define a message to be published by the broker on behalf of the client,
      since the client is offline and cannot publish anymore

-> QoS Level Description
    + max 1 transfer try : brings best possible transfer in unstable Networks. Message loss possible
                           Suitable for massive sensor data where one lost message does not harm the
                           communication flow (geo data)
    + min 1 transfer try : reliable transfer of the message. Could be delivered twice

    + exact 1 transfertry: for UC where a unique delivery is essential.
